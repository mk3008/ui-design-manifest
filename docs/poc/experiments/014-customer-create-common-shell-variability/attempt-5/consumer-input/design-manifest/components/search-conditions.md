# Guidance

Place conditions before the results they refine. Make the action that applies a declared query primary and make clearing subordinate. Use a stable semantic action order so placement can change without changing the intent or display copy. Do not introduce a condition, helper text, validation state, or query behavior unless product requirements or binding supply it.

Give the condition region a concise group caption so its purpose remains
recognizable beside the result set. The caption is present even when no
supporting explanation is needed. A group description is optional: place it on
the next line only when product-supplied context adds meaning beyond the
caption, visible fields, and actions. Do not use a decorative container merely
to compensate for an omitted caption. A group caption names the field group; it
does not require a fieldset border, card, filled panel, or extra inset spacing.

When [record-list options](../configuration/record-list-options.md) resolves a
search action region, create a dedicated condition-action toolbar directly
below the condition fields. Make the toolbar a separate structural row within
the condition region, then place the complete action group inside it. For the
default `end` region in a left-to-right interface, align the action group's
right edge with the condition region's right edge. In CSS Flexbox, implement
that horizontal placement with `justify-content: flex-end` on the toolbar or
its full-width action-group container; use `align-items` only for vertical
alignment. Keep the resolved action order in both source/tab order and visual
order; for the default `[search, clear]` value, render Search followed by
Clear. This toolbar structure and order are a presentation consequence of the
existing configuration, not a new setting or a permission to create actions.

# Selection conditions

Use this component only when the product exposes query state and a result set that it affects. If a clear operation does not exist, omit it; configuration cannot create it.

# Relationships

Use with the [searchable record list](../screen-patterns/record-list.md) and [record-list options](../configuration/record-list-options.md).
