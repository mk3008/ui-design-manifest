# Guidance

Define theme colors by semantic role rather than by component or literal hue.
This pack fixes a small role vocabulary and supplies editable concrete values
for each required mode in
[Theme colors](../configuration/theme-colors.md). Components consume the role
meaning; they do not choose a new literal color for each occurrence.

At minimum, distinguish page and raised surfaces, primary and muted text,
subtle and interactive borders, action foreground and background, links,
selection foreground, background, and indicator, visible focus, and paired
foreground/background roles for success, information, warning, and error.
Apply the same role consistently across components.

Treat `information` as a semantic status role, not as a substitute for the
action accent or selection role. A blue brand or action color does not
automatically make a surface informational. Likewise, success, warning, and
error colors do not create those states; they reinforce product-supplied state
meaning.

Keep content and controls readable at the contrast required by applicable
requirements. Do not use color as the only cue for status, selection,
validation, required state, current navigation, progress, or interactive
affordance. Pair color with text, shape, icon, position, border, or another
programmatically available cue.

Keep brand color separate from semantic status roles. Light and dark modes may
change a role's color value and surface-layer relationship, but must not change
its meaning or make the same color mean conflicting states. Preserve visible
boundaries where adjacent surfaces would otherwise merge.

This business-app pack requires both `light` and `dark` modes. Apply the same
semantic roles, content, task structure, available actions, and state meaning
in both modes. Do not infer high-contrast, tenant, or additional
user-selectable modes from either palette.

The color-and-theme foundation does not decide whether a theme-selection
control appears in a Header, menu, settings screen, or host shell. That
placement, its visible caption, icon, and interaction model belong to the
Header or host-shell contract. If a product supplies a two-state icon-only
command, its accessible name must describe the next action. If it supplies
`system`, `light`, and `dark`, present the alternatives explicitly rather than
cycling an unlabeled button through three states. `system` resolves to one of
the two required palettes; it is not a third palette.

# Configuration boundary

The concrete `#RRGGBB` values for all required roles and modes are
manifest-owned configuration. The values in
[`theme-colors.default.yaml`](../configuration/theme-colors.default.yaml) are
maintainable defaults for this business-app pack, not universal design truths.
A manifest consumer may replace them through one reviewed local theme-color
override while preserving every role ID and meaning.

A theme does not create a status, selection, permission, action, or business
meaning. Changing a value changes presentation only. Changing, removing, or
repurposing a role changes the contract.

# Product boundary

The product binding owns theme identity, the available mode-selection
capability, selectable preferences, initial preference source, persistence,
brand constraints, and additional applicable requirements. It does not own or
override the concrete role values. An arbitrary in-application color editor is
a separate product capability and is not implied by the editable manifest.

# Implementation boundary

CSS custom-property names, theme loading, system-preference integration,
fallback behavior, transition behavior, and framework are implementation
decisions. The implementation must apply the resolved manifest values without
changing their semantic roles. Verify both required modes and every state
combination. A static application specimen is illustrative evidence, not
contrast or assistive-technology certification.
