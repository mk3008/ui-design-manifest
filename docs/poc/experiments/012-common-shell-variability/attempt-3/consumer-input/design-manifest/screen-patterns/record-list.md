# User task

Help an operations user locate a record, compare dense repeated attributes,
understand its current state, and open an available record without losing list
context.

# Guidance

Keep the search task separate from the result set and preserve stable scanning cues after a query is applied. The Search action is primary; Clear is subordinate and only clears a product-declared query state. Associate a row operation with its record and expose a frequent, singular operation rather than hiding it in an overflow menu. Apply the [compact work surface](../foundations/compact-work-surface.md), [search conditions](../components/search-conditions.md), [result grid](../components/result-grid.md), [pagination](../components/pagination.md), and [status badge](../components/status-badge.md). Resolve only the finite placement and presentation choices in [record-list options](../configuration/record-list-options.md).

Use the [page header](../components/page-header.md) to identify the search task
before the conditions. It may carry a supplied purpose description, but it
must not manufacture a category label that merely repeats the collection or
screen name. Treat the result summary as part of the grid, not as a second
page header.

# Transition roles

This pattern provides the `open_record` role and requires the [list-to-detail flow](../flows/list-to-detail.md) when the product binding declares that opening a record is available. It does not own the destination, permission, record identity, query persistence, page position, or scroll restoration.

# Unresolved

Feature availability, query semantics, result data, count meaning, page state, routes, permissions, bulk selection, responsive transformation, and all non-default states require product binding or requirements before implementation. Creation and editing are optional transition roles, not configuration values; use them only when the binding declares them.

# Pattern selection

Use this pattern when dense comparison of common attributes, sorting, or rapid
repeated scanning is the task. Use [search with cards](search-with-cards.md)
when individual identity, varied summaries, or record-unit browsing is more
important. A product requirement or application task chooses the pattern; this
pack does not provide a `grid | card` configuration switch.

# Relationships

- [List-to-detail flow](../flows/list-to-detail.md) - Owns the cross-screen decision criteria and context-restoration principle.
- [Record detail](record-detail.md) - Provides the corresponding destination role when the product binding supplies it.
