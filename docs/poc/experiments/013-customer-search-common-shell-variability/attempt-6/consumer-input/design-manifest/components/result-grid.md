# Guidance

Keep each row's scanning cues and available operation associated with the same record. Reserve the strongest row-level treatment for one frequent operation; use an overflow presentation only when the product has multiple low-frequency operations. Do not decide which columns, records, values, statuses, row count, loading state, permission state, selection model, or sort model exist: those belong to product binding.

When the binding supplies multi-selection, use a leading checkbox column and make
selected and unselected rows distinguishable without relying on color alone. Do
not add visible `Select` or `Selected` text next to every checkbox merely to
demonstrate its state; the control's accessible name remains binding-owned. A
header checkbox is permitted only when the binding also supplies select-all
availability. When selection is absent, omit the selection column and selected
row treatment entirely.

When the binding supplies a sort model, show its active direction in the
corresponding column header. Do not put an active sort choice in detached page
chrome, and do not persist sort indicators for inactive columns. When sorting
is absent, do not infer a sortable header or direction state.

Let the host assign the grid width and outer spacing. Keep meaningful columns
at widths appropriate to their role rather than stretching them merely to fill
the grid. If the assigned width has residual space, use one trailing,
presentation-only empty column; it has no label, value, operation, sort state,
selection meaning, or responsive behavior.

Use a tone-distinct header row to separate the column labels from the result
body. The header consumes `table_header_background` and
`table_header_foreground`; every ordinary body cell consumes
`surface_background` and `text_primary`, rather than inheriting the host's
`page_background` or becoming transparent. This keeps the data surface
visually separate from the workspace without inventing per-screen colors. Use
the exact resolved values of those roles; `selection_background`, an
information surface, or an invented literal is not a substitute for the table
header roles. Use one horizontal row separator to preserve scan tracking. Do
not draw vertical cell dividers by default: they add visual noise to a dense
scan task. Do not place the grid inside a decorative card or frame merely to
create containment; use an outer boundary only when it prevents the grid from
merging with adjacent, supplied content without creating unused interior space.

Represent one product-declared attribute in each ordinary grid cell. Do not
combine an identifier with a title, or otherwise combine two independent
business attributes, merely to make the grid narrower or more decorative. A
binding may explicitly request a composite cell only when it supplies the
constituent attributes, their hierarchy, and the scanning reason; otherwise
preserve separate columns and values.

Keep the result title and any product-declared count in one compact summary
immediately above the grid. When `result_count_presentation: summary` resolves
and the binding supplies an aggregate, render the count immediately after the
result title on the same heading line. Do not detach it to a far edge or give it
a separate heading line. Do not show a query or filter summary by default. If
the binding supplies an applied-query summary with its meaning, show that
summary on the following line; it describes the result set, rather than
restating editable fields, teaching a visible action, or inventing text such as
an implied current filter. Place an operation that acts on the
visible result collection in the result grid's adjacent toolbar or action zone,
rather than in unrelated page chrome. Keep that toolbar associated with the
result title and summary, rather than separating the title from an unrelated
instruction at the opposite edge. When the binding declares
that an action creates or otherwise changes the visible result collection,
place it once at the logical end of that result-summary action zone. When the
binding instead declares page-level scope, place it in the page header. The
binding owns that scope; do not infer it from an action label or static fixture.
For a collection action in a screen that already has a primary Search action,
use the pack's lower-emphasis outlined or tertiary button treatment rather than
introducing a second primary button. A different supplied action hierarchy may
justify another treatment, but it must be explicit in the binding.

When one frequent operation opens a record and the binding supplies a stable,
human-recognizable primary identifier or title, prefer that leading identity
cell as the record-opening link. Do not add a second trailing `Details` link
only to demonstrate navigation. If the binding does not supply a suitable
identity link, use the configured row-action presentation in a logical-end
action column. Keep destructive or multiple low-frequency row operations
separate from the primary record-opening treatment and use the existing
overflow rule when it applies.

# Avoid

Do not use a presentation setting to turn an absent action into an available one, or to hide the only frequent action behind an overflow menu. Do not invent selection, select-all, sorting, or column semantics from a static fixture.

# Relationships

The [searchable record list](../screen-patterns/record-list.md) supplies the screen role. The [list-to-detail flow](../flows/list-to-detail.md) governs an available `open_record` operation.
