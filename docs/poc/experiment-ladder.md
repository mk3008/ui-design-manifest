# UI Design Manifest PoC experiment ladder

> Experiments may use original UI evidence only as test oracles. Standard application receives a source-blind manifest packet and target-product inputs; accepted historical results require revalidation before they demonstrate this boundary.

The ladder tests small, observable claims in order. It dogfoods two things: whether extraction methods expose useful business-application observation points, and whether source-independent Markdown communicates the retained roles and relationships through reconstruction and semantic re-extraction. Passing one gate permits the next experiment; it does not prove overall utility, fidelity, or canonical status. Keep raw artifacts so an independent evaluator can distinguish observation, inference, authored defaults, contextual patterns, and target-product decisions.

## Gate 1 — Structure discovery

**Question:** Can a fresh reader locate relevant manifest concepts without loading the whole bundle?

**Raw evidence:** reader transcript or tool log, files opened in order, selected concept paths, elapsed navigation notes, and broken-link/front-matter check.

**Pass signal:** the reader starts at `index.md`, finds the bounded concepts, and can state their scope and provenance.

**Stop/rework:** missing routes, misleading descriptions, invalid front matter, or reliance on undocumented directory knowledge. Repair indexes or profile wording before extraction.

## Gate 2 — Bounded extraction

**Question:** Can an extractor use permitted source evidence to exercise the observation method and produce a small valid bundle while separating observation, inference, authored defaults, contextual patterns, target-product decisions, and gaps?

**Raw evidence:** scope declaration, viewport/state captures, extraction transcript, output tree, evidence and inference registers, unresolved list, and validation output.

**Pass signal:** every claim is traceable or labeled, the bundle is navigable and structurally valid, excluded source areas remain uninspected, and the output is treated as a candidate rather than automatic canonical knowledge.

**Stop/rework:** copied implementation code, unlabeled inference, scope drift, missing critical evidence, or a catalog-sized output. Narrow scope or rewrite before reconstruction.

## Gate 3 — Manifest-only visual reconstruction

**Question:** Can a fresh implementer reconstruct a bounded static slice using target-product inputs plus only relevant Manifest concepts, without seeing the source UI, so the Markdown's communication quality can be evaluated?

**Raw evidence:** exact input packet, files opened, implementation diff, rendered captures at declared viewports, guidance trace, assumptions, and build/test output.

**Pass signal:** the slice runs, the evaluator can trace visible decisions to manifest concepts, and no prohibited source evidence reached the implementer.

**Stop/rework:** source leakage, missing runnable output, unverifiable guidance influence, or gaps that force material invention. Improve the manifest rather than coaching the implementer informally.

## Gate 4 — Interaction reproduction

**Question:** Can the reconstructed slice apply the nominated interaction responsibility and relevant states from the allowed inputs?

**Raw evidence:** scripted or recorded interaction, before/after captures, focus and keyboard observations, state transitions, console output, and functional test results.

**Pass signal:** the bounded interaction completes and required observable states are represented without violating requirements.

**Stop/rework:** critical state absent, interaction ambiguity, inaccessible operation, or behavior inferred beyond evidence. Return to extraction or obtain a product decision.

## Gate 5 — Independent comparison

**Question:** Can an evaluator who did not extract or implement identify agreements, deviations, and unsupported choices?

**Raw evidence:** side-by-side captures or recordings, evaluator rubric, issue list with evidence references, severity rationale, and manifest-to-result trace.

**Pass signal:** findings are reproducible, scoped, and distinguish manifest gaps from implementation mistakes and acceptable higher-precedence deviations.

**Stop/rework:** evaluator received hidden source context, conclusions lack raw evidence, or the rubric embeds unstated style preferences. Reset the comparison before human acceptance.

## Gate 6 — Human visual acceptance

**Question:** Does the product owner judge the bounded result useful enough to continue the PoC?

**Raw evidence:** source and reconstruction shown at declared viewports/states, prior evaluator findings, owner decision, requested changes, and rationale.

**Pass signal:** the owner explicitly accepts the bounded result for the experiment and identifies the next useful scope. Promotion to shared knowledge remains a separate, explicit decision.

**Stop/rework:** rejection, unresolved requirement risk, or no explicit judgment. Record whether to revise extraction, profile guidance, implementation, or the experiment itself. Do not translate acceptance into a general fidelity guarantee.
